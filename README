If you're not sure yet what you're doing, you should probably just read
the DEVELOPERS file even if you're not a developer. Until we have some better
docs created, that file is probably the best explanation of how to set this up,
and reading it will also give you an idea of what this does.

##############################
This enrolment plugin works very much like the database enrolment plugin, except
that we query a remote database via MNet. This is as much a proof-of-concept as
anything else. This requires serious know-how to set up. I'd like to make it
easier, but for now, if you are seriously interested, seriously capable (of
writing code), and have questions, feel free to drop me a line (address below).

The overall idea is to use this to integrate in real-time with any arbitrary
database-backed Student Information System.

Ideally, we would be using SIF or IMS-LIS instead of a hacked-together solution
like this. But:
    * many SISes do not support either of those specs
    * I have a client who needs something implemented sooner rather than later. Specs are good, but shipping code wins...

I hope this gets conversations started about how real-time Moodle+<something>
integration can be improved.
